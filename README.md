## Pre-commit hook
To keep the code clean we'll use a few tools that will make sure everything in the code is looking the proper (pythonic) way. Those tools are:
 - flake8 - which includes: Pyflakes, McCabe and pycodestyle
 - isort - which sorts all the imports the right way
 - black - code formatter.

To install `pre-commit` hook use `uv`:

    `uv add pre-commit`
